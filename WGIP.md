In the Wikipedia Game, where players aim to navigate from one Wikipedia article to another using only hyperlinks within the articles,
incorporating the A* algorithm can enhance the game experience by optimizing the pathfinding process. Instead of relying solely on breadth-first search,
A* considers both the cost of reaching a node from the start and an estimated cost to reach the goal, prioritizing paths that are not only shorter but
also more contextually relevant. This improvement could make the game more challenging and engaging, requiring players to not only find the shortest path
but also consider the semantic relationships and relevance between articles.

Pseudo-code for A* algorithm in the Wikipedia Game:
```
  function AStar(start, goal):
      openSet = PriorityQueue()
      openSet.add(start)
      cameFrom = {}
      gScore = {}
      gScore[start] = 0
      fScore = {}
      fScore[start] = heuristic(start, goal)
    
      while openSet is not empty:
          current = openSet.pop()
        
          if current == goal:
              return reconstructPath(cameFrom, current)
        
          for neighbor in getNeighbors(current):
              tentativeGScore = gScore[current] + 1
            
              if tentativeGScore < gScore[neighbor]:
                  cameFrom[neighbor] = current
                  gScore[neighbor] = tentativeGScore
                  fScore[neighbor] = tentativeGScore + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                  if neighbor not in openSet:
                      openSet.add(neighbor)
                    
      return "No path found"

  function heuristic(node, goal):
      // Calculate heuristic based on semantic relevance between articles
      return semanticRelevance(node, goal)

  function semanticRelevance(node, goal):
      // Calculate semantic relevance between articles based on some metric
      return relevanceMetric(node, goal)
  
  function relevanceMetric(node, goal):
      // Calculate relevance based on semantic similarity, topic overlap, etc.
      return relevanceScore(node, goal)
```
